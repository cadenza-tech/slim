 * nothing to tell the copies apart. Keyed on the range rather than on `offense.line`, because the
 * two are not the same thing: a line past the end of the buffer clamps onto one that is already
 * there. The message is part of the key even though `disableComment.ts` leaves it out of its own -
 * the linter is `RuboCop` for every cop, so dropping it would silently merge two real findings. How
 * many times an offense was reported goes with the repeats: nothing in the panel could show it.
