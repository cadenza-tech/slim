// The shape of a text document as the vscode-free layers see it. Types only, no runtime code.

// A DocumentSnapshot is a live view over a vscode.TextDocument (src/documentSnapshot.ts), never a

// document.version around its prompt.

// These live here rather than beside their first consumer because several modules need them and
// none of those is their subject: diagnosticMapper is about offenses, wrapBlock about rewriting.
