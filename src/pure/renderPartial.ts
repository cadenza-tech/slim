 * whitespace, a comma, a closing bracket or a quote. Narrower would be wrong - a directory may be
 * named `my-dir` even though a partial may not.
 *
 * An interpolation that closes before `closed` is part of the name - brace, quotes, commas, spaces
 * and all - which is what hands `"cards/#{kind.tr('-', '_')}"` back whole and still ends
 * `"cards/#{kind}, title: "` at its comma. In single quotes `#{` interpolates nothing, but it is
 * written there by mistake often enough, in a literal that is just as complete. One that nothing
 * closes is text, and no bar to stepping over the next: `#{ki` is `#{kind}` being typed in front of
 * a `/#{size}` that is already there. A `}` left over further along does close it, as it does for
 * Ruby, and the name runs that far: `"cards/#{ki, title: "x" }`. Telling that brace from the
 * interpolation's own would take reading the Ruby inside.
 *
 * Any other value ends at its first comma and nowhere before it. A title holds spaces, brackets, an
 * apostrophe and the word `do`, and resuming among them hands them to the scan as Ruby: `do` ends
 * the argument list, and `[` takes the rest of the line for a group. A comma of the title's own
