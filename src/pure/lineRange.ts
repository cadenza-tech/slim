/**
 * Turns a selection into the whole lines a refactoring should act on, or null when there are none.
 *
 * The extension at the end is the important part: raising a parent one level without its children
 * would leave them at the parent's own depth and silently detach them, which is the same failure
 * src/pure/disableComment.ts exists to avoid.
 *
 * It extends past the end while lines are deeper than the selection's *shallowest* indent, not just
 * past the last selected line's own block. A selection covering two same-depth siblings can end in
 * the middle of the second one, and asking findBlockEnd about any single line would leave that
 * sibling's remaining children behind. Everything up to the next line at or above the shallowest
 * indent belongs to something selected - and so does a `- else` or `- when` sitting exactly at it:
 * that is a branch of the statement the selection opened, and leaving it behind re-binds it to
 * whatever the refactoring puts in its place.
 *
 * Indents are compared in columns as Slim counts them, so a file mixing tabs and spaces nests here
 * the way it renders.
