// The partial completion provider declares ' and " as trigger characters, because the grammar hands a
// partial name to source.ruby and editor.quickSuggestions.strings defaults to off, so nothing else
// would open the widget there. A trigger character is a per-registration argument, but the trigger path
// itself is VS Code's: it also folds in the built-in snippet support, and a Slim file is full of quotes.
//
// What keeps that from turning every quote into a popup is that no contributed Slim snippet starts with
// one and the word-based provider declares no trigger characters at all - neither of which is a contract
// this extension controls. So the outcome is pinned here rather than reasoned about.
//
// executeCompletionItemProvider cannot answer this: it asks every provider regardless of triggers, and
// whether the widget opens is SuggestModel's decision. So these tests type the character for real and
// then ask the widget to accept whatever it has selected. With no widget open that is a no-op. Nothing
// cheaper works either: a provider registered with no trigger characters of its own is not asked during
// a trigger character session, so one cannot be added here to watch a session start.
