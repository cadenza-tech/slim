 * `saleWindows_NT.slim` and per-linter include/exclude matching would silently miss it.
 *
 * The escaping is ported from cross-spawn's escape.js (MIT, https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn,
 * itself based on https://qntm.org/cmd): caret-escape every metacharacter - which also splits
 * `%NAME%` pairs so percent expansion never sees a name - and give arguments the pass twice,
 * because cmd parses the line once for itself and once more when it hands off to a batch file.
